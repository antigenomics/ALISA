# Algorithms for inverse statistical approaches

Solving inverse problem of statistical mechanics: determining Hamiltonian representation parameters from an observed sample of states of the system.

### Planned features:

* **Hamiltonians** Spin glass and multi-layer spin glass, pairwise interactions only.
* **Representations** Flexible Hamiltonian and state representations: sparse/dense vectors and matrices, simple tensors.
* **State encodings** Flexible system of state encodings: one-hot and k-mer encodings for protein sequences, real vector state representations based on AA physicochemical properties.
* **Models** Built-in models for protein regions, pairs and triples of interacting protein regions. This should cover T-cell receptor (TCR) selection, TCR chain pairing, TCR:peptide:MHC recognition, antibody affinity maturation, virus evolution, peptide:MHC binding, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) interfaces in general.
* **Model inference** Monte Carlo-based approaches and direct maximum likelihood approaches in case partition function can be simplified analytically.
* **Hybrid models** Combining multiple independently-trained models
* **Predictors** TCR selection probabilities, TCR specificity prediction, virus fitness evaluation, PPI partner prediction, ...
